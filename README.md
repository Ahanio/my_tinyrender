# My tinyrender
My simple implementation of rendering based on [this course](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) (btw the course is great). Unlike it is instructed in the course, I wrote the code in python. I used numpy to make it faster.

The goal of this project is to learn how to render an object (given in obj format).

Structure:
* lessons1-6.ipynb - prototyping first steps (the code here is a real mess)
* my_render/ - at some point I brushed up the code a bit and made it more structed. So here is more structed version with shader abstraction
* obj/ - .obj .png files of 3d models

Here is my progress:

#### 1. First of all we need to know how to render simple primitives like a line, (filled) triangle:

<p float="left">
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/1.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/2.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>
</p>

#### 2. After parsing obj file and applying the methods above we have:




<p float="left">
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/3.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/4.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
</p>

Knowing a triangle normal and light directions we can get this (intensity ~ n*l):

<img src="./teaser_imgs/5.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Yet there is smth wrong with the mouth.

#### 3. Introducing z-buffer solves the issue:

<img src="./teaser_imgs/6.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

Changing the gray color on the known texture gives us this:

<img src="./teaser_imgs/7.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

(wow!)

#### 4. The next step is to take into account that we take an image from a camera view. So we need to implement perspective projections:

<img src="./teaser_imgs/8.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

#### 5. While rendering the colored triangles we used barycentric coordinates (to understand if a point is inside a triangle). And here it helps us again: knowing color (or anything else) of triangle vertices we can interpolate it all over the triangle (using the barycentric coordinates):
   
<img src="./teaser_imgs/9.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>

#### 6. Adding normal and specularity maps. Minor modifications of shader leads to the following results.
   
<p float="left">
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/10.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/11.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
  <img src="./teaser_imgs/12.png" alt="drawing" width="400"/>
</p>
